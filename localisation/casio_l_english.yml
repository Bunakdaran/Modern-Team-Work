 dan_integrate_norway_title: "Integrate Norway"
 dan_integrate_norway_desc: "Norway and Denmark have long have their fates intwined. Bringing Norway into the Danish fold is the  logical next step in this relationship."
 dan_secure_iceland_title: "Secure Iceland"
 dan_secure_iceland_desc: "The Norwegian Crown controlled many of the islands of the North Sea and beyond back in days of yore.  However, in recent years, their control of these islands has come under threat from both autonomous subjects and the ambitions of the  Britons."
 dan_colonise_greenland_title: "Colonise Greenland"
 dan_colonise_greenland_desc: "Greenland was home to a Norse settlement many centuries ago, and perhaps was inhabited right up until  the beginning of the 15th century. We should reclaim this vast landmass once more, and secure its valuable whale supplies."
 dan_vinland_title: "Settle in Vinland"
 dan_vinland_desc: "Long ago our ancestors reached these far-off lands and called them Vinland after the many grape vines that grew  there. We must lay our claims to this supposedly rich corner of the world."
 dan_viking_ships_title: "Norsemen of the Sea"

 dan_raids_title: "Raiding Culture"
 dan_raids_desc: "The Vikings were well known for their raids upon coastal and river-bourne settlements across Europe. If we are  embracing other aspects of Old Norse culture, why not this too? While raiding may severely annoy our neighbours, it provides us with a  vast bounty of gold."

 dan_varangian_guard_title: "Varangian Guard"
 dan_varangian_guard_desc: "The Varangian Guard were elite bodyguards to the emperor in Constantinople, sourced from Norsemen in the  lands of the Rus' and Scandinavia.

 dan_schleswig_holstein_desc: "There has long been and long will be a divide in the south of core Denmark - between Germany Holstein  and Danish Schleswig. While the two may be united under the rule of Count Adolf III, his death may hark a new era for the region, that  under closer Danish rule."

 dan_emperor_desc: "[Root.GetName] has been on the edge of the Holy Roman Empire, acting as nothing more than an observer, for hundreds  of years.

 byz_restore_patriarch_authority_desc: "The authority of the Patriarchate of Constantinople has been waning for many years now. Even  our sister states in Russia are beginning to break away and have dreams of independent churches. It is clear we need to re-establish  the authority of our church else the whole faith may collapse."
 byz_heal_the_schism_title: "Restore the Pentarchy"
 byz_heal_the_schism_desc: "The Orthodox NGOs has faced constant threats for hundreds of years, as a result losing many of its  significant cities and falling increasingly reliant on Latin Christians for help.

 byz_reclaim_jerusalem_title: "Reclaim Jerusalem"
 byz_reclaim_jerusalem_desc: "Ever since we lost the holy city of Jerusalem to the rising Arabs back in the 7th century, Christians  from across Europe have attempted to reclaim it many times, sometimes successful, but mostly not. Until now, we have showed little  interest in this effort, relegating ourselves to little more than the road through which Crusades pass. It is time we take efforts  into our own hands and use our rising power to crush its occupants and at last seize Jerusalem." 
 byz_appeal_for_help_title: "Appeal for Aid"
 byz_appeal_for_help_desc: "The fear that Constantinople will soon fall to the cannon of Mehmed II has driven us to great lengths to  seek diplomatic and military aid from Christians everywhere.

 byz_conquer_albania_desc: "An impressive rebellion against Ottoman rule has triumphed many times, successfully defending their lands  for years.

 byz_reformed_mercenaries_title: "Mercenary Reform"
 byz_reformed_mercenaries_desc: "In 1204, Constantinople was brutally sacked by Venetian mercenaries while supposedly on contract with  the Emperor. This experience has taught us not to trust mercenaries, but sometimes they are necessary. Adding to these experiences,  Europe is generally moving towards permanent professional standing armies, a trend that we too should also follow. Restoring elite  local forces might also improve our defensive armies."

 zimb.1.t: "Europeans in Awe of Great Zimbabwe"
 zimb.1.d: "In the south of our lands, a sprawling metropolis once existed, the largest such south of the Sahara. Great Zimbabwe was  the capital of the old Kingdom of Zimbabwe, which exerted influence from this walled city across the region. However, with the decline  of the Zimbabwean state the city fell into disrepair and was largely abandoned by its population. Even now, it is still a magnificent  feat of architecture, so much so that European travellers to our country show great interest in it."
 zimb.1.a: "This will put Zimbabwe on the map!"
 
 zimb.2.t: "Discovery of Great Zimbabwe"
 zimb.2.d: "[Root.GetAdjective] emissaries in Zimbabwe have discovered a site of unparalleled significance - a place the locals call  'Symbaoe' or Great Zimbabwe. It is the remains of a once-great walled city, but is so large in size that we struggle to see who could  have constructed it. Clearly, further research done by professionals is needed to properly understand this site."
 zimb.2.a: "Finance an expedition to uncover more about this amazing place."
 zimb.2.b: "It's not worth our attention."
 
 zimb.3.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Expedition"
 zimb.3.d: "Diplomats from [From.GetName] have today informed us that they plan to lead an expedition to the site of Great Zimbabwe.  Crossing inland to the site will be dangerous for them, and hence they ask us for our permission and protection on the journey to and  fro."
 zimb.3.a: "Let them study the site."
 zimb.3.b: "This treasure is ours only!"
 
 zimb.4.t: "Expedition to Great Zimbabwe Approved"
 zimb.4.d: "The rulers of [From.GetName] have approved our expedition to Great Zimbabwe. Our explorers and best natural scientists are  readying themselves to make the journey, which will surely go down in history."
 zimb.4.a: "A vast array of treasures awaits us!"
 
 zimb.5.t: "Expedition to Great Zimbabwe Denied"
 zimb.5.d: "The rulers of [From.GetName] have decided not to support our expedition to Great Zimbabwe. Given how potentially dangerous  it will be for our men going inland into uncharted territory, support for the expedition has faultered and it now looks as if it will  not go ahead."
 zimb.5.a: "Perhaps we should resort to more covert actions..."
 
 zimb.6.t: "Changamire"
 zimb.6.d: "Originally a herdsman in the Mutapa Kingdom, Changamire would go on to be the leader of the revolt against Portugese  colonisation in the 1680s, succeeding in evicting them from the central plateau and leaving them with only coastal settlements. A  revered ruler, the title 'Changamire' was adopted by subsequent kings in his honour. His fearsome warriors gave the new kingdom its  name - the Rozwi Empire. His Empire united Zimbabwe for the first time in centuries, and remained a regional power until the 1800s."
 zimb.6.a: "A great king!"
 zimb.6.b: "Make him an advisor!"
 
 mdg.1.t: "Andriamanelo"
 mdg.1.d: "Andriamanelo was a king in the highlands of Madagascar, responsible for the founding of the Kingdom of Imerina. In his rule  he set out many of the traditions which his country and the later Kingdom of Madagscar would come to cherish until European  colonisation, including succession and marriage reform, defensive walls, the noble class, and iron-tipped spears."
 mdg.1.a: "He will rule over us!"
 mdg.1.b: "Enact his reforms, but he is not fit to be King."
 
 mdg.2.t: "Europeans want to Trade"
 mdg.2.d: "A band of Europeans has today arrived in Madagascar, looking to trade their goods with us in exchange for slaves."
 mdg.2.a: "A great deal!"
 mdg.2.b: "Turn them away."
 
 kil.1.t: "The Portuguese Emissary"
 kil.1.d: "A diplomat from the far-off land of Portugal has arrived at our court today, requesting an alliance between his nation and  ours. He says that this will be beneficial to both of our trade profits, and that Portuguese troops will help defend the throne should  its legitimacy fail."
 kil.1.a: "Send him packing!"
 kil.1.b: "Accept the alliance."
 
 ass.1.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is Assassinated"
 ass.1.d: "Our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been assassinated! Rumours are circulating it was the filthy  bastards of [doing_ass.GetName] who are responsible. While it may take some time for us to recover, we must avenge this unjust killing  eventually."

 ass.2.a: "Damn."
 
 ass.3.t: "Successful Assassination"
 ass.3.d: "We have received word that our assassins succeeded in killing their target."
 ass.3.a: "And the world is a better place for it!"
 
 ass.4.t: "An Attempted Assassination"
 ass.4.d: "Last night [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was almost killed by a gang of unruly brutes, bearing a striking  [doing_ass.GetAdjective] likeness. Thankfully, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] survived, but now our guard must be up to defend another from  another attack."
 ass.4.a: "Hunt them down! Wring them like the rats they are!"
 they_tried_to_kill_us_tooltip: "§Y[doing_ass.GetName]§! is behind the attack on our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 
 swe.1.t: "Gustavus Adolphus"
 swe.1.d: "Gustav II Adolphus, also known as Gustavus Adolphus, was perhaps the greatest ruler Sweden ever had. Ascending to the throne  at the age of sixteen whilst his kingdom was at war with Russia, Poland, and Denmark, he proved himself to be formidable on the  battlefield, earning the title the 'father of modern warfare'. He established a firm Swedish grip on the Baltic Sea, becoming the  undisputed regional hegemon, enacted extensive centralisation and economic reforms domestically, and led a highly successful war  against the Catholic League during the Thirty Years War. This war was Sweden's crowning achievement, a glorious campaign that would  result in the total destruction of a third of Germany's towns and the reputation of Gustav as the 'Lion of the North'. In 1632, he was  killed at the Battle of Lützen, robbing Sweden of its greatest asset and beginning the rocky decline of the Swedish Empire."
 swe.1.a: "Make this Lion a King."
 swe.1.b: "He will serve as an advisor instead."
 
 usa.1.t: "The Continental Congress"
 usa.1.d: "In 1774, the first Continental Congress convened to discuss the relationship between Great Britain and her American  colonies, aimed at establishing a peaceful result to the conflict. By the time of the Second Congress, hostilities were inevitable and  the failure of the Olive Branch Petition left the government no choice but to draft a Declaration of Independence, issued in 1776.  After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation became the first official government of the United States, lasting  until 1789 when a more streamlined and democratic 1st United States Congress was created by the recently ratified Article 1. This  legislative body guided the United States through the centuries under the guidance of strict checks and balances, operating in harmony  with both the executive and judiciary."
 usa.1.a: "Let us convene a Congress."
 
 usa.2.t: "Congress Approves Our Legislation"
 usa.2.d: "Recently Congress has been remarkably cooperative with regard to passing administrative policy issued by the [Root.GetTitle]  and executive branch."
 usa.2.a: "Excellent."
 
 usa.3.t: "Congress Approves Our Legislation"
 usa.3.d: "Recently Congress has been remarkably cooperative with regard to passing trade and diplomatic policy issued by the [Root. GetTitle] and executive branch."
 usa.3.a: "Good good."

 usa.4.d: "Recently Congress has been remarkably cooperative with regard to passing military policy issued by the [Root.GetTitle] and  executive branch."
 usa.4.a: "Smashing chaps."

 usa.5.d: "Recently Congress have been blocking our administrative policy, claiming it is an over reach of the powers of the executive."
 usa.5.a: "Blasted fools!"
 
 usa.6.t: "Congress Blocks Our Legislation"
 usa.6.d: "Recently Congress have been blocking our trade and diplomatic policy, claiming it is an over reach of the powers of the  executive."
 usa.6.a: "Put up or shut up."
 
 usa.7.t: "Congress Blocks Our Legislation"
 usa.7.d: "Recently Congress have been blocking our military policy, claiming it is an over reach of the powers of the executive."
 usa.7.a: "And the people voted for these idiots?"
 
 usa.8.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Vetoes Congress"
 usa.8.d: "In response to a rather contraversial new bill introduced to Congress today, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has excersised  their presidential veto, much to the dismay of Congress, who are beginning to assemble a coalition with which to overturn the veto."
 usa.8.a: "This is well within my rights."
 usa.8.b: "Revoke the veto."
 
 usa.9.t: "The Impeachment of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 usa.9.d: "In response to numerous allegations of wrongdoing and acting ultra vires, the Senate has begun the impeachment trial of the  [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. While this is clearly a move motivated by congressional spite, it deserves to be addressed seriously."
 usa.9.a: "Bribe them to overturn the impeachment."
 usa.9.b: "Resign."
 
 usa.10.t: "Congress Blocks War Support"
 usa.10.d: "In response to the clash between the executive and legislative branches, Congress has denied us further war support."
 usa.10.a: "Attempt to bypass them."
 usa.10.b: "We will have to accept this."
 
 usa.11.t: "Campaign Trails"
 usa.11.d: "Over the years there have been many accusations that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not represent a democratic enough  institution. Now, with support in Congress waning, many are calling upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] to make an effort to actually win over  the public vote and the congressional one two, via an expansive campaign trail across the country."
 usa.11.a: "Very well, let us embark on such a journey."
 usa.11.b: "I don't need consent to govern. What a ridiculous notion."
 
 ass.8.t: "Political Destabilisation"
 ass.8.d: "A ring of spies operating within our government, at the orders of the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName], have sown  the seeds of ruin within our nation. Already people are beginning to question our legitimacy to rule, and efforts made by our  authorities to calm the situation down appear increasingly costly..."
 ass.8.a: "What can we do?"
 they_destabilised_us_tooltip: "§Y[From.GetName]§! ordered their spies to destabilise us."
 
 ass.9.t: "Defences Sabotaged"
 ass.9.d: "Allegedly a ring of spies has infiltrated our military command, influencing our war efforts. Soldiers are abandoning their  garrisons en masse, after being told they are on leave and can go home. Those who protect our very walls are departing, leaving us  vulnerable to attack."
 ass.9.a: "I didn't say you could leave!"
 they_sabotaged_our_defences_tooltip: "§Y[From.GetName]§! ordered their spies to sabotage our defences."
 
 ass.10.t: "Treasury Ransacked!"
 ass.10.d: "A group of rowdy, greedy men snuck into the treasury room last night, after earning the trust of our guards. Now they have  left, we find the treasury almost empty with only a few gold coins scattered around the corners."
 ass.10.a: "This wasn't a tax day was it?"

 opinion_stole_our_money: "Stole our money"
 
 ass.11.t: "Rampant Corruption"
 ass.11.d: "In recent times their corruption within our government have been growing faster than ever. Previously easy and ordinary  tasks are now taking many months to be carried out and come with extra baggage in bribes to those passing it. They say money is the  grease in the wheels of politics, but this has gone too far."
 ass.11.a: "I need me some pork."
 they_bribed_our_officials_tooltip: "§Y[From.GetName]§! ordered their spies to bribe our officials."
 
 ass.12.t: "Buckets of Ducats"
 ass.12.d: "In our recent successful raid on a foreign treasury we have gained vast riches, and only further damaged the economical  situation of our rivals."
 ass.12.a: "Money makes the world go round."
 we_stole_x_money_tooltip: "We stole §G[Root.ste_money_amount.GetValue]¤§!."
 
 gbr.1.t: "Factionalism in Parliament"
 gbr.1.d: "As Parliament grows in size, so to does its responsibilities. The monarch's chief advisor has gradually evolved into a  position put forward by the Houses of Commons and Lords, becoming the Prime Minister. Now the system is more elective, support is  needed more than ever, leading to a growing wave of factionalism spreading throughout Parliament. These groups - the two major being  the Whigs and Tories - have enough concensus to work together occassionally, but will otherwise block policy passing at a whim. The  Radicals seek to shake up politics both at home and abroad and enforce their revolutionary agenda."
 gbr.1.a: "I know who I'm voting for..."
 gbr.1.b: "Attempt to reassert the power of the monarch."
 
 gbr.2.t: "The Tax of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 gbr.2.d: "Believing the Crown is facing dire financial times, today [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has issued a  declaration stating [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] intention to raise a new tax. Parliament has expressed dismay at this annoucement,  claiming this to be a breach of its sovereignty. On which side do we fall?"
 gbr.2.a: "Ignore Parliament - introduce the tax."
 gbr.2.b: "Heed their demands."
 
 gbr.3.t: "The Amicable Grant"
 gbr.3.d: "In 1525, excited by the prospect of a renewed more successful campaign against his now captured enemy Francis I of France,  Henry VIII and his Lord Chancellor Thomas Wolsey introduced the 'Amicable Grant', essentially a tax levied on all goods that the  clergy would pay in higher proportion. Most significantly, the tax was introduced without the consent on Parliament, leading many to  see it as illegal and thus refused to pay. Henry had done this purposefully, knowing that Parliament would not approve any further  taxes to finance his war after he had already failed to repay his loans taken from it in 1522-3."
 gbr.3.a: "Introduce the Grant."
 gbr.3.b: "Respect the sovereignty of Parliament."
 
 gbr.4.t: "Trouble with the Amicable Grant"
 gbr.4.d: "After King Henry VIII levied the Amicable Grant, it became clear it was only going to cause trouble. Many clergymen admitted  they would not be able to pay it, with the whole country financially exhausted. Discontent grew across the rural east and north of the  country, culminating in a revolt in Lavenham. While the turmoil was eventually calmed by the combined forces of the Dukes of Norfolk  and Suffolk, Henry was forced to repeal the Amicable Grant. Without his much needed war funds, he had to pull out of France and make  peace."
 gbr.4.a: "Repeal the Grant!"
 gbr.4.b: "Force them to pay it!"
 
 gbr.5.t: "The Lincolnshire Rising"
 gbr.5.d: "Both the King and his advisors were keen to assert the independence and control of the NGOs of England over the country.  The seizure of church properties and valuable metals as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries was part of this, and caused much  resistance amongst the clergy and public. After 1st October 1536, some 40,000 ordinary people marched into Lincoln and occupied  Lincoln Cathedral, protesting for the protection of Catholc freedom to worship and the treasures of the churches around Lincolnshire.  The protest ended when Henry VIII warned the protestors to stand down else face the army of the Duke of Suffolk, which was amassing at  the time."
 gbr.5.a: "Continue the seizure of Catholic property in Lincolnshire."
 gbr.5.b: "Guarantee them religious and economic autonomy."
 
 gbr.6.t: "The Pilgrimage of Grace"
 gbr.6.d: "In October of 1536, in response to the brutal manner in which the Lincolnshire Rising was put down but also due to numerous  other factors like high food prices and opposition to the dominance of Thomas Cromwell, a rebellion broke out in Yorkshire, led by  Robert Aske. After occupying the city of York, the rebels called displaced Catholics back to their homes and evicted the King's  officials. The sheer size of the army amassed by Aske drove terror into the hearts of the nobility, forcing the Duke of Norfolk and  Earl of Shrewsbury to enter negotiations. Once a royal pardon and reprieve for the abbeys was secured, the rebel army disbanded. By  February, these demands had still not been met, resulting in a separate rebellion unlinked to Aske that prompted a much more severe  reaction from the nobles and Crown. Many rebel leaders were captured and executed, along with many priests, leaving the masses at the  mercy of the armies of the Duke of Norfolk."
 gbr.6.a: "Crush the rebels!"
 gbr.6.b: "Attempt to negotiate."
 
 gbr.7.t: "The Field of the Cloth of Gold"
 gbr.7.d: "Held in June of 1520 near Calais, the Field of the Cloth of Gold was a significant summit between Henry VIII and Francis I,  solidifying the 1514 Anglo-French Alliance and  establishing Henry as a king of great prestige. A large temporary palace was  constructed to hold the meeting, rivalling anything build before and displaying the wealth behind it with its arrays of glass. Two  monkeys gifted by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I brought great joy to both kings and helped soften relations between them. Henry  challenged Francis to a wrestling match that he quickly lost, bringing a sour ending to it for the English king. After all the money  spent on the meeting, it proved to be futile, as England, in alliance with Holy Roman Emperor Charles V,  faced hostile relations with  its war enemies in France."
 gbr.7.a: "Hold a grand celebration of our friendship!"
 gbr.7.b: "We need to be preparing for war, not diplomacy!"
 
 gbr.8.t: "Proclamation by the Crown Act"
 gbr.8.d: "In 1539, the contraversial Proclamation by the Crown act was passed. This act made it so royal proclamations, that is, the  word of the monarch, were to be treated like passed Acts of Parliaments and followed such. While it marked the high point of Henry  VIII's despotism, it was not used often and was eventually repealed in 1547. This issue of royal proclamations would however rise once  again during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and Stuart tyranny."

 gbr.9.b: "There is no need for such reform."
 
 gbr.10.t: "The Great Fire of London"
 gbr.10.d: "Between the 2nd and 6th of September 1666 a fire ravaged London, destroying much of the City in the process. While not many  people died, hundreds of properties were destroyed and thousands of people were left homeless. Discontent hit a new high and King  Charles feared an open rebellion against the Crown, leading to him providing much-needed bread to the starving. Rumours of a French or  Dutch plot circled, leading to violence against foreigners in London. It is now thought that the fire started in a bakery on Pudding  Lane, but quickly spiralled out of control due to the failures of local authorities to tackle the blaze while they still could."
 gbr.10.a: "London will recover eventually."
 gbr.10.b: "Offer as much aid as is needed to rebuild the city!"
 
 gbr.11.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Renaissance"
 gbr.11.d: "Long after the Renaissance Era had passed in Italy, England experienced its own cultural golden age under the reign of  Queen Elizabeth I. Promotion of the arts was at an all-time high due to the remarkable disposable income of many of the country's  wealthy from agriculture. Architects, composers, playwrites and authors flourished, producing famous faces like Francis Bacon, Thomas  Morley, John Dunstable, and William Shakespeare."

Although he did not find employment here, he played a major role in the Ottoman  siege of Constantinople the next year, creating a massive cannon known as 'the Bear' to hammer the ancient walls. Along with lots of  smaller cannon, Orban's work ensured a constant bombardment of the city that helped keep the defenders' morale low. Now he is here at  our court, offering his services to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 foc.3.t: "Giovanni Giustiniani"
 foc.3.d: "Giustiniani was a Genoese captain who led Genoese and Greek forces in defense against the Turks at the Siege of  Constantinople. He was instrumental in keeping the morale of the defenders up, stopping any quarrelling between the different  nationalities present at the defense, and helping the Byzantines face overwhelming odds and hold out the siege for as long as they  did. As a mercenary he led a professional force of 700 men, who were hired by emperor Constantine XI in 1453. He was injured on the  final assualt on 29th May, reportedly struck with a cannon as Ottoman troops entered the city. He died three days later in Chios."

 koftn_got.6.t: "Piracy on Gotland"
 koftn_got.6.d: "Eric of Pomerania lived on Gotland and made a living through piracy in the Baltic. Perhaps we should continue with  this lifestyle, and merge the principles of the feudal monarchy with more swashbuckling ones."

 dan.1.t: "Death of Count Adolf VIII of Holstein"
 dan.1.d: "The old Count of Holstein, Adolf VIII was nominally a count of the Holy Roman Empire due to his primary inheritance on the  German side of the border. When he was given the Duchy of Schleswig 1439 by Christopher III of Denmark, he also became a nominal  Danish fief. Now that Adolf has died and has left no recognised heirs to the throne, the two provinces of Schleswig and Holstein are  in danger of being torn apart oncemore.

 foc.4.d: "This day will live in history forevermore. At last, after a prolonged siege, the City of World's Desire has fallen to [Root. Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], who shall henceforth be known as 'the Conqueror'. Ever since the days of the Prophet,  Islamic states have tried repeatedly to succeed in taking the city, but none have been successful until now. This siege revolutionised  warfare as a whole, forcing artillery into center stage for the first time against perhaps the toughest walls in the world. Moreover,  it shocked the Christian world to its core, leading to a permanent drift between the Latin and Eastern churches, as well as the end of  the Age of Crusades. Byzantine scholars fleeing the siege and following sack would go on to spread their knowledge and works to the  western world, proving to be a significant boost to the already building Renaissance."
 foc.4.a: "The City is ours!"
 
 foc.5.t: "The Sack of Constantinople"
 foc.5.d: "With Turkish troops streaming into the City of World's Desire, a decision needs to be made on how to treat it. [TUR.Monarch. GetName] had promised a period of looting for his soldiers, but with his ambitions to make it his new capital and a growing  appreciation for the city's architecture, this practice could be under threat."

 foc.6.b: "It's too costly."
 
 foc.7.t: "The End of the Roman Empire"
 foc.7.d: "After nearly 1500 years of continuous existence, it appears the Roman Empire has finally come to an end. With the fall of  Constantinople, the gates of Europe now stand open for the Ottomans, a far more ambitious force than once thought.\n\nAs the Turks  broke into Constantinople, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] valiantly threw aside his imperial regalia, joining his men  for one last charge into the enemy. Although cut down by the Turks, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] death is a brave and deserving one if  anything."

 geo.1.d: "For too long the nobility have had free reign over the lobbies of the Kingdom of Georgia. Alexander I's last ditch effort to  restore the power of the monarchy by dividing the kingdom have well and truly failed. Now, it seems the Kingdom is in its death throes. "

 foc.13.t: "Dire Situation in the East"
 foc.13.d: "In recent years, the resurgent Ottoman Empire has practically been at the gates of Constantinople, threatening the last  holy city besides Rome with another Islamic fate. There are suggestions, particularly from pro-Byzantine camps, that we declare  another crusade to aid to the Byzantines and hopefully evict the Turks from the Balkans once and for all. However, after the  disasterous defeat of the Crusade of Varna in 1444, many monarchs in Europe are not willing to participate in any renewed conflicts.  If we do not act, there are fears that the City of World's Desire could fall within months."
 foc.13.a: "Declare a crusade to support our friends in Constantinople!"
 foc.13.b: "We could use this situation to our advantage..."
 foc.13.c: "Heretics deserve to die as such."
 
 foc.14.t: "The Papal Demands"
 foc.14.d: "The Pope has promised support for our valiant defence of the Holy City, but only in return for negotiations to end the  Great Schism. We are not in a great situation here, and would end up making many concessions, far more than the Greek Orthodox  population would accept. While it may seem an obvious choice, we must also consider the value of any support for our cause."

 foc.14.b: "Desperate times call for desperate measures."
 
 foc.15.t: "Our Demands Refused!"

 foc.16.t: "[Root.GetName] Heals the Schism"
 foc.16.d: "In return for a new crusade and Papal aid Byzantine diplomats have agreed to end the Schism, mostly on favourable terms for  the Latins.

 foc.17.t: "Pope Calls for a Campaign Against the Ottomans"
 foc.17.d: "With the recent declaration of crusade against the growing Ottoman Empire, many Christians have taken up arms and thrown  themselves at defending Constantinople, but the Pope and his Byzantine contacts fear this response is not enough.

The House of Osman, whose Sultans once marched huge armies and won glorious battles, asserting dominance over much of the  Balkans and Anatolia, has at last been overthrown and pacified. While the spirit of Turkic raiders has not been broken and we will  always face more conflict as we push further east, this victory has improved the morale of both our troops and people signficantly."

 gbr.14.t: "The Strangers"
 gbr.14.d: "The Elizabethan Era saw England act as the protector of Protestants and Reformers, sheltering them from persecution on the  continent. One such instance of this can be found with the peoples of the Low Countries, who had adopted Protestant faiths but lived  under the oppression of Spain, a fiercely Catholic state equiped with its renowned Inquisition. Fleeing from this persecution, many  refugees chose to settle in England, particularly in the city of Norwich, becoming known as 'the Strangers'. At one point, nearly a  third of Norwich's population were Strangers. They transformed the local economy with their weaving skills, replacing the old  wool-based trades of Norfolk with more complex cloth ones, substantially adding to local prosperity."

However, under the influence of warmonger Cardinal  Julian Cesarini, Hunyadi was convinced that breaking the truce he had agreed to was not sinful not a real betrayal as it was with a  Muslim, leading to a second Hungarian invasion of Ottoman lands, this time supported by the Polish Crown and its resources. The young  Sultan fell back to his father for assistance, eventually demanding that he return to office and lead his armies against this new  crusade. Murad obliged and on 10th November 1444 the combined Polish-Hungarian-Wallachian forces were soundly defeated at Varna,  killing Cesarini and the Polish-Hungarian king Władysław III, and bringing a crashing end to the crusade. This new peace with the  Christians was distrusted after the recent betrayal. Instability rocked the Sultanate, including a revolt of the elite Janissary  infantry in 1446. Facing potential peril, Murad came back and took the throne once more to manage the situation and give his son more  time to gain experience in a less dangerous situation. Murad died in 1451, leaving the throne to Mehmed for a second time. By this  time, Mehmed had grown as a person and become much stronger and formidable in the eyes of Christendom, as well as having gained an  obsession with conquering the city of world's desire - Constantinople."

While some in the court sought a return to older forms of warfare and harked back to the  glory days of the 16th century, the Sultan Selim III envisioned a reformed Ottoman army, trained in Western styles of warfare, an  advisory body of Western military officials, and a private treasury for financing further administrative reform. This was the Nizam-I  Cedid, or 'New Order'. Initially they were highly successful, with the new troops proving their worth on the battle field in the 1799  Battle of Acre, but ultimately a reactionary coalition within the government resulted in widespread opposition from conservative  factions and Selim was overthrown in 1807 by a Janissary coup."

The Fall of  Constantinople marked the coming of the end for the Orthodox Greek world, as soon they lost all trace of independence. As claimants to  the Roman Empire, the Palaiologos dynasty held considerable prestige and thus fled to Morea initially, before moving to the Italian  Peninsular and selling their meaningless titles to the monarchs of Europe. Morea quickly fell to Latin hands, leaving only the Empire  of Trebizond, a small strip of land on the northern Anatolian coast, as the last independent Orthodox Greek state. In 1461 however,  this city fell also to Mehmed the Conqueror. With this fall, the Greek Roman Empire was well and truly dead."

During this time, he made significant and long lasting reforms to the administration of the  region. His most important work however came in his foreign relations, an area in which he excelled at dealing with Western Christian  threats to the empire, such as negotiating the vassalage of Hungary as well as the long-standing Franco-Ottoman alliance in its  infancy. As his power and fame grew, he became more arrogant and started to attract the ire of his political competitors.

 mus.1.t: "The Plot Against Vasiliy"
 mus.1.d: "Prince Vasiliy II of Moscow had by 1445 struggled with many pretenders for the throne. The brother of the military leader  Dmitry Shemiaka, Vasily the Cross-Eyed, had in 1435 been banished from the Kremlin by an alliance between Vasiliy and Dmitry, though  their relationship was growing more strenuous. In 1446, whilst in battle against Ulugh Muhammad of the Kazani Khanate, Vasiliy was  captured, leaving Dmitry in control of Moscow. While the Russian state slowly gathered the required ransome money, Dmitry solidified  his control on the country. The return of Vasiliy heralded no victory, as he was quickly blinded and exiled, Dmitry fearing that the  former would again rise from the ashes and reclaim the throne."
 mus.1.a: "We have no choice but to surrender the throne."
 mus.1.b: "Traitor!"
 
 mus.2.t: "The Return of Vasiliy"
 mus.2.d: "Under pressure from Vasiliy's supporters in Moscow however, Dmitry recalled him from exile and gave him an appanage. Using  this newfound position, the exiled Prince gathered his support and reclaimed the throne, hunting down and poisoning Dmitry in the  years to come. At last, the Muscovite Civil War was over and order was restored by Vasiliy. However, his struggles had come at a cost  - he was blind and perpetually ill, leaving him in no position to rule the country effectively."
 mus.2.a: "Support Vasiliy's rebellion."
 mus.2.b: "It is he who is the traitor here."
 
 mus.3.t: "Rise of [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 mus.3.d: "Due to the severity of Vasiliy's condition, he made his son Ivan, later Ivan III of Moscow, co-ruler towards the later years  of his reign. Together with Metropolitan Jonah, the nominal head of the Russian Orthodox NGOs, they guided the country through times  of relative stability and successful campaigns against Moscow's enemies, leaving the stage set for Ivan to forge a powerful Russian  state."

 mus.4.t: "Breaking of the Tartar Yoke"
 mus.4.d: "Throughout the 1400s, Muscovy continued to operate as the chief tribute collector for the now disintergrating Golden Horde,  still acting as subjects while growing more autonomous than ever. In 1476, Muscovy was in a strong enough position under its Grand  Prince Ivan III to refuse to pay tribute, causing Ahkmed, Khan of the Great Horde, to conclude an alliance with Casimir IV of Poland  and begin preparations for an invasion. The two armies gathered in 1480, Ivan solving quarrels with his brothers to secure his throne  beforehand, and met on the banks of the Ugra River. In the so-called 'Great Stand', Akhmed, perhaps fearing Russian firepower, seeing  Casimir not honour his alliance and disliking the poor weather in that time of year, withdrew from the battlefield, leaving the  Muscovite forces triumphant without a proper battle. For many, this moment was considered to be the final breaking of the Tartar Yoke,  the tribute-grip of Mongol successor states on the Russian principalities since the 1240s."
 mus.4.a: "The Yoke is broken!"
 
 mus.5.t: "Fate of the Levantine Christians"
 mus.5.d: "Since the birth of Christianity many followers of the true faith have lived within the Levant, especially in Palestine and  Jerusalem. With the Ottoman conquest of Palestine, the question of rights to protection of the Levantine Christians has risen again,  with new parties looking to stake their claim. Orthodox Christians, a remnant of the fallen Byzantine Empire, are by far the majority  of the significant sects in the area - perhaps as the leader of the Orthodox faith we should proclaim our protection of these peoples,  but only with Ottoman permission."

 mus.8.t: "Rights to Levantine Christians Denied"
 mus.8.d: "It appears the Ottomans are arrogant and thoughtless, as they have denied our offer to act as protector of the Levantine  Christians. Perhaps we will have to enforce our protection through warfare after all."

 tur.27.t: "The Eastern Question"
 tur.27.d: "For years now, the Ottoman Empire has been the powerhouse of Islam, its rulers claiming the titles of Ghazi and Caliph,  embarking on remarkable conquests and scaring Europe into submission. Now, with advances in European technology not reaching the  shores of Anatolia, there are increasing fears the empire is in a permanent decline. Numerous poor decisions have gradually lent power  and control to foreign nations, weakening the supremacy of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and threatening to upset the global balance of  powers. If the situation in the East is to be stabilised, either the Ottoman Empire will have to assert itself once more on the world  stage, or the combined great powers will have to intervene."

 mus.12.d: "Originally one of a great many boyar families within the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, the marriage of Anastasia Romanov to Ivan  IV, the self-proclaimed Tsar of Russia propelled them to immense influence and fame. Due to the troubled succession of Ivan the  Terrible, a period of constant conflict and succession struggles overcame Russia, known as the Time of Troubles. Resolving this  problem became a top priority for the boyar families, and eventually after decades of civil war Mikhail Romanov was elected as Tsar,  beginning the reign of the Imperial House of Romanov. They would rule over Russia for the next three hundred years, arguably the  golden era for the country, only being deposed at the onset of communist revolution in 1917."

This new revolt threatens to alter the balance of powers, to the detriment of the western Europeans in  particular. As a result, some of the Great Powers have paid close attention to the goings on in Belgium, regardless of their view on  its independence.

 lit.3.t: "Illiterate Peasantry"
 lit.3.d: "Traditionally the vast majority of a country's population has been made up of illiterate, god-fearing peasants, usually  accountable for the bulk of the food production, tax income and manpower of the nation. The illiteracy of the peasantry is an  important tool for controlling them, as it keeps them trapped within their social status and makes them rely on their local church for  any information not spread by word of mouth. Some fear that with increasing social mobility, this bond may be broken and it may become  ever harder to control the poor."

Practically only clergymen were literate, and any works  of literature were produced by monks, even those consisting of either the Bible or commentary on religion. However, with the spread of  the printing press throughout Europe, this stranglehold had been gradually eroding. Now more than ever, it is possible for single  creators to publish their own works and widely distribute them, threatening to tip the balance of power in society against the church  once and for all."

 waf.5.a: "Excellent."
 
 waf.6.t: "The Occupation of Timbuktu"
 waf.6.d: "In 1430, the Tuareg tribes descended from the Sahara and captured Timbuktu, the center of trade in the region. This control  has made them rich, but their are concerns from amongst the populace that the city has been mistreated. Due to their concerns, the  elite of the city have today issued an invitation to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to liberate Timbuktu from the  Tuaregs once and for all."
 waf.6.a: "Accept this invitation."
 waf.6.b: "This is none of our business."
 
 waf.7.t: "Tolerating the Heathens"
 waf.7.d: "Several key government officials have accused us of being overly tolerant of our heathen subjects and officials. They say we  are straying from the true Muslim faith in pursuit of cooperation with an enemy."

 waf.7.b: "We cannot abandon our roots."
 
 waf.8.t: "The Rise of Songhai"
 waf.8.d: "We have received word that the ambitious lords of Songhai have captured Timbuktu, the richest trade city on the Niger River.  The fall of this city marks a shift in the power balance in the region, as Songhai continues to assert dominance and show itself as a  rising power. Mali, on the otherhand, does not seem to be keeping up with them or even trying to curb their power. If nothing is done  this could spell the end of the empire."
 waf.8.a: "Worrying."
 
 waf.9.t: "Control Over Timbuktu"
 waf.9.d: "Ever since the [Root.GetAdjective] conquest of Timbuktu, we have struggled to control the rouge city. The Tuareg inhabitants  are causing friction with our authorities and generally increasing unrest in the city. Drastic actions may be required to soothe  divides and secure Timbuktu into our hands."
 waf.9.a: "Expell the Tuareg. Only then will peace be returned."
 waf.9.b: "They can stay, let the city sort it out itself."

 waf.10.t: "The Capture of Jenné"
 waf.10.d: "The great Sonni Ali was the Sultan that led the emerging Songhai Empire to its glory. After capturing Timbuktu, he turned  his attention on the declining Mali Empire and its fragile tribute network to the north and east of its core. Amongst this area was  the lucrative city of Jenné, which was a major trading dock rivalling Timbuktu situated on the Niger River. After a brutal siege of 7  months and 7 days, the city fell to Songhain forces. In the chaos of the chief of Jenné died, allowing Sonni Ali to marry the chief's  widow and effectively vassalise the city, restoring peace to the region for at least a short while."
 waf.10.a: "Make love, not war."
 waf.10.b: "Loot the city and move on."
 
 waf.11.t: "Patronising the Sankore Madrasah"
 waf.11.d: "The Sankore Madrasah, a prestigious and historic university in the city of Timbuktu was founded by Malian Mansa Musa in the  14th century, though the buildings that make it up are much older. Wealthy and cultured rulers often patronised this facility,  including the Songhain Askia dynasty after their conquest of the city."
 waf.11.a: "Spare extra funds for the expansion of the facility."
 waf.11.b: "It is doing fine without us."
 
 waf.12.t: "The Fulani Jihad"
 waf.12.d: "The Fulani people have long been a part of life in West Africa. First unifying into a single political force in the 1470s,  the people of Fulo have spread across the whole region, integrating themselves into local elites and peoples. The religious leaders of  these people, fiercely Muslim, look out to the weakening of the other Islamic states of the world as they bend knee to Western  Christianity, and spit in disgust. They believe the only true leaders of the faith are those they create, and hence a number of  radicals are calling for the creation of a new Caliphate in West Africa. Resentment and conflict with the native African faiths, long  tolerated by the Muslim population, has increased exponentially and it now looks like a brutal Jihad is arising against them."
 waf.12.a: "One thing is certain - this will change the world."
 
 waf.13.t: "Boom in the Salt Trade"

 waf.15.b: "Take a share for ourselves."
 
 idea.6.t: "Facing the Odds"

 idea.9.t: "We are Aggressive"
 idea.9.d: "It appears our neighbours have caught on to the fact that we are aggressive imperialists who will stop at nothing to claim  their land and riches. As such, our internation reputation is beginning to suffer."

 idea.9.b: "Blame the politicians!"
 
 idea.10.t: "An Army With A State?"
 idea.10.d: "There has been some question recently as to whether [Root.GetName] is more of a state with an army like other nations, or  an army with a state. Fears of military dictatorship may run deep, but the idea of a strong army is more than enough to keep our  officials quiet."
 idea.10.a: "Army with a state."

 swi.1.t: "Service of Swiss Mercenaries"
 swi.1.d: "The service of Swiss mercenaries in our enemies has proven to be a god-send for our tired soldiers, who know earn a much  needed rest while the Swiss take over their positions. Well-disciplined and respectful, these mercenaries are little like those we  have come to expect in Europe - roudy, greedy, and prone to sacking important cities."
 swi.1.a: "They are fine soldiers indeed."
 swi.1.b: "Perhaps we could learn a thing or two from them?"

 mva.1.d: "Many centuries ago our ancestors called up the lobbies of the realm for advice and help governing this rich and diverse  land. Now, it is time once again to call upon the lobbies.\nDuring discussions over regular activities and issues in [Root.GetName],  the suggestions of allowing the diet greater powers and possibly making it permanent came up, garnering a lot of support amongst the  members of the clergy, nobility and merchant classes alike. These radical proposals would result in us taking a republican reform led  by the lobbies, with power concentrated locally. Clearly those in the royal household and its neighbours do not approve of this, but  these reforms to show promise and could lead to be a better situation for the people we claim to serve."
 mva.1.a: "This is nonsense. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should be in control."

 mva.2.t: "Moravian Supremacy"

 ire.1.t: "The Gaelic Resurgence"
 ire.1.d: "In the centuries prior Anglo-Norman lords had conquered much of Ireland in the name of the Kingdom of England. By the 14th  century however, their authority was waning and they were assimilating into the native population at an increasing speed, becoming the  Hiberno-Normans or 'Old English'. The Black Death only accelerated this trend, hitting the urban Norman settlements much harder than  the rural Irish ones and leaving the Hiberno-Normans as little more than a minor ruling elite. The 1367 Statutes of Kilkenny attempted  to stem this tide by banning English settlers and lords from speaking Irish or adoption Irish customs, but England's power over the  land had all but collapsed and hence this was mostly ignored. Central government continued to dimish in Ireland as England became  distracted with other conflicts like the Hundred Years' War and the War of the Roses, leaving the Lordship of Ireland in the hands of  the Earl of Kildare. By the mid 15th century, a great Gaelic resurgence is underway - it looks possible that one day in the near  future England could lose the Pale, its last fortified foothold on the island, and the Irish would be free to self-govern once more."

 strat_fabian_strategy_tooltip: "§YFabian Strategy§!\nNamed after Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, dictator of the Roman Republic  during the time of the Second Punic War, this strategy is best used against forces more powerful than your own to gradually reduce  them down into a withdrawal. By avoiding all-out battles and engaging in a campaign of attrition against enemy armies, we can weaken  the morale of their soldiers and cut their supply lines while also denying the opportunity for any telling victories."
 
 strat_decapitation_tooltip: "§YDecapitation§!\nAs the name suggests, this strategy involves cutting off the head of enemy opposition,  usually the heads of state and military. Through careful assassination and precise incursions behind enemy lines, we can take down an  enemy government without expending too much military effort, drastically reducing their capabilities to fight."
 
 strat_flanking_tooltip: "§YFlanking§!\nThis is the principle of hitting hardest at the sides or flanks of an enemy army, where it is  typically less well defended and through which a successful break can shatter their whole formation. Mounted warriors are able to use  this strategy particularly well due to their maneuverability and speed."
 
 strat_total_war_tooltip: "§YTotal War§!\nTotal War is a strategy by which all available resources are used to fund the war effort,  complete significance is afforded to the military in the eyes of the government, civilian facilities and buildings are considered  legitimate targets, and any conventions or laws on warfare will be disregarded. Brutal but effective against less-mobilised enemies,  this strategy will help us pack a punch but will considerably hurt our nation if continued in the long run."
 
 strat_human_wave_tooltip: "§YHuman Wave§!\nUsed only when the attacker has numerical advantage, the human wave involves masses of  infantry charging at enemy lines with no effort made to protect them or manage their charge. It aims to break enemy formations by  sheer weight of force."
 
 strat_win_without_fighting_tooltip: "§YWin Without Fighting§!\nSun Tzu, in his infamous 'Art of War' expressed the preference to 'win  without fighting' by foiling the enemy's battle plans and not engaging in assaults unless the sides were equal in volume. Through  careful diplomacy and a clear pacifistic agenda, we may be able to avoid seemingly unavoidable conflicts and usher in a new era of  peace."
 
 strat_raiding_tooltip: "§YRaiding§!\nOften employed by armies lacking in supplies or not being paid by central authorities, raiding  involves looting and pillaging enemy settlements for their riches, with the warriors often keeping these fortunes for themselves.  Nomadic hordes make good use of this strategy to effectively destroy local resistance and enforce a reign of terror on conquered  peoples."
 
 strat_blitzkrieg_tooltip: "§YBlitzkrieg§!\nThrough the use of heavy armour and powerful firing instruments, we can quickly march and  shatter enemy lines, seeking to crush resistance and capitulate the country as soon as possible. Encirclement is a key tactic within  this, relying on fast moving units and intensive pre-planning."
 
 strat_crescent_tooltip: "§YCrescent Formation§!\nOttoman armies often assembled themselves into a formation resembling the crescent  moon, with large infantry flanks around the edges that are able to surround enemy forces when outnumbering to a significant enough  degree and effectively annihilate their men, leaving no space for retreat."
 
 strat_admiralty_tooltip: "§YAdmiralty§!\nReforms to the British army and navy in the late 18th and early 19th centuries led to a more  meritocratic system where generals and admirals were employed based on skill and achievement rather than noble birth. With these  reforms we will create a new generation of fine admirals with which we can rule the waves."
 
 strat_legions_tooltip: "§YLegions§!\nIn the olden days of the the Roman Republic and then Empire, it won its vast territories and  brilliant victories through the use of the innovative legionary system. Ten cohorts of men made up each Roman Legion, allowing strong  ties between fellow soldiers and increased manueverability between parts of the army on the battlefield."
 
 strat_splendid_isolation_tooltip: "§YSplendid Isolation§!\nThe British Empire grew massively during the 19th century, after emerging  as the world's foremost super power since the Napoleonic Wars. After the collapse of the Concert of Europe, Britain entered a stage of  'splendid isolation', where it had no permanent alliances and would only intervene in wars only to uphold the status quo. During this  Pax Britannica the homeland prospered and industry made the Empire the greatest economic power on Earth."
 
 strat_marry_austria_tooltip: "§YHappy Austria, Marry§!\nIn the words of Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus, 'Let others make war, you  happy Austria marry, for kingdoms given to others by Mars, Venus will give to you.' As the most supreme power on the diplomatic stage,  thrones will practically fall into our laps with little need for conventional military measures."
 
 strat_conquistadors_tooltip: "§YConquistadors§!\nThe conquest of the Americas was mainly done by autonomous Conquistadors, who trekked  and mapped the whole continent while subduing the natives and endlessly questioning them about mythical golden cities. Famous  conquistadors include Hernan Cortes, the conqueror of the Aztec Triple Alliance, Francisco Pizarro, the conqueror of the Inca Empire,  and Francisco de Coronado, whose search for the legendary Cities of Gold led him throughout the Rio Grande region and beyond."
 
 strat_carolean_army_tooltip: "§YCarolean Army§!\nReforms to the Swedish army after the reign of Gustavus Adolphus transformed the old  mercenary-based system to a much small but professional force. Strict in their religious customs, the Caroleans acted as almost a  crusading force in their campaigns against foreign powers, often inflicting massive losses on the enemy while taking relative little  themselves."
 
 strat_corps_system_tooltip: "§YCorps System§!\nDeveloped by military innovator Napoleon, the corps system divides an army into  separate sections each with their own infantry, war machine and artillery, and capable of their own strikes. This system gave France an  enormous advantage against other European armies and would be quickly copied as a result. By absorbing fire and allowing the mass of  troops to be concentrated on a weak point on enemy lines, the corps system was resistant to traditional flanking and could not be  easily broken."
 
 strat_imperial_russian_army_tooltip: "§YImperial Russian Army§!\nRegiments of streltsy and New Order troops had served the emerging  Russian Empire well, but they were becoming decadent and undisciplined in the face of such success. Thus, in 1699 Peter the Great  issued perhaps the first national mandatory conscription in the country, affecting peasants and boyars alike. Picked by a quota  system, these people would originally serve for life but the length of service gradually shrunk over the years. The army, trained and  organised in a distinctly Prussian manner, performed well on the battlefield, only faultering against the machine of Revolutionary  France, although Russia would eventually come out on top and lead the charge to occupy Paris in 1814. At its peak, the army would  amass some 15 million men."
 
 strat_dutch_marines_tooltip: "§YDutch Marines§!\nFounded as the 'Regiment de Marine' in 1665, whilst the Dutch Republic was fighting  the emerging First English Empire in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, were a special regiment of the Republic's army for use in landings  and raids. Frequently, sections of the Marine Corps would be engaged in coastal raids, quickly landing on enemy territory from ships  and sailing away once more, similar to the traditional hit-and-run tactics used by steppe hordes but on the seas."
 
 strat_bavarian_standing_army_tooltip: "§YBavarian Standing Army§!\nA declaration by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1681 required all the  princes to contribute a permanent proportion of a united Imperial Army. After this, seeing the power and sense of statehood it brought  other countries, Bavaria began the construction of a standing army, something only employed by the Great Powers otherwise. With help  from Prussian, French and Imperial military thinkers, as well as their standardised blue uniforms, the Bavarian army was able to punch  above its weight throughout a turmoltous period of European history."
 
 strat_armed_neutrality_tooltip: "§YArmed Neutrality§!\nThroughout its whole existence, the Swiss Confederacy has pursed a neutral path  through the many European wars. After Swiss independence was confirmed in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, war became a foreign issue for  them. Instead, Swiss citizens would go out and fight as mercenaries in other countries' wars, gaining a reputation as skilled and  loyal warriors."
 
 strat_arab_horsemen_tooltip: "§YArab Horsemen§!\nThe deserts of Arabia are home to skilled horsemen. Throughout history local rulers  have used these warriors on campaigns, to flank larger infantry armies, to scout far into enemy lands without being caught, and to  loot bordering towns. While they may be unruly and potentially rebellious, with a little cash incentive these men can be hired."

Condemned as heretics, many attempts were made by the rulers of Savoy, France and Sardinia-Piedmont to convert them or  displace them from their traditional valleys, all in vain.
